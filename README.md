# CSE12: Computer Systems and Assembly Language and Lab - Spring 2023
#### Work by Kaushal Ramesh

## Course Overview
CSE12 offers an introduction to computer systems, assembly language, and the fundamental principles of how computers operate both in hardware and software. This 7-credit course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of digital logic, number systems, data structures, the compiling/assembly process, basics of system software, and computer architecture. With an integrated lab component, the course emphasizes practical, hands-on experience to complement the theoretical knowledge gained in lectures.

## Labs Overview
The course includes four intensive labs, split evenly between digital circuitry and assembly language programming. These labs are crafted to solidify the concepts discussed in lectures through direct application, allowing students to experiment and see firsthand the workings of computer systems and assembly language.

### Digital Circuitry Labs
#### Lab 1: Introduction to Digital Logic and Circuit Design
- **Objective:** Understand the basics of digital logic circuits. Design and simulate simple logic circuits using software tools.
- **Topics Covered:** Logic gates, combinational logic, circuit simulation.

#### Lab 2: Building a Simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- **Objective:** Design a simple ALU that can perform basic arithmetic and logical operations, reinforcing the concepts of digital design and integrated circuits.
- **Topics Covered:** ALU design principles, binary arithmetic, and logical operations.

### Assembly Language Labs
#### Lab 3: Looping in RISC-V Assembly
- **Objective:** Introduce RISC-V assembly language programming with a focus on nested loops to generate a specific pattern, written to `lab3_output.txt`.
- **Key Skills:** Basic assembly operations, file manipulation, loop constructs.

#### Lab 4: Paint Application in Assembly
- **Objective:** Create a "Paint" application in an emulated RISC-V environment, allowing users to draw patterns using keyboard inputs on a bitmap display.
- **Key Skills:** Function calls, graphical output manipulation, keyboard input handling.
